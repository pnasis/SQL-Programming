# SQL-Programming
SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This repository contains some sql queries I wrote. I used MySQL Workbench as a DBMS, hosting MariaDB.

Contents:
1)The Database dump file (chinookdump.sql). This database has data about a series of cds.
2)The answers(queries_answers.sql)

**NOTE: Query 13 is not answered!**

The expected results for every query are: \
1: 15 rows \
2: 14 rows \
3: 25 rows \
4: 8 rows \
5: 11 rows \
6: 2 rows \
7: 1 row \
8: 4 rows \
9: 1 row \
10: 2 rows \
11: 4 rows \
12: 62 rows \
13: 14 rows \
14: 209 rows \
15: 10 rows
