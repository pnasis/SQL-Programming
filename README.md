# SQL-Programming
SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a relational database. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. This repository contains some sql queries I wrote during a university course. I used MySQL Workbench as a DBMS, hosting MariaDB.

Contents:
1)The Data Base dump file (chinookdump.sql). This database has data about a series of cds.
2)The answers(queries_answers.sql)

!NOTE: Queries 13 and 15 are not answered)!
